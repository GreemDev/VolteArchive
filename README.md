# Volte Archive

I see you've found this repo. So, I guess you're wondering: "What is this?" Glad you absolutely didn't ask.

There's 3 branches on this repo other than `main`. `v4`, `v4-kotlin`, and `v2`. These are unused and unmaintained versions of my Discord bot, [Volte](https://github.com/Ultz/Volte).

Feel free to hack away on these. `v4-kotlin` is a personal favorite of mine as it uses a majorly tweaked and rewritten version of jagrosh's [EasySQL](https://github.com/jagrosh/EasySQL) for using the H2 database.

However, there's also *v1*. Volte's initial state. As disgusting as the code is, I feel it's important to keep around to show how much I've changed as a developer.


Thanks for reading, and thanks for using Volte, if you do.
